# Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis attempts to determine the intrinsic value of coin/token using underlying information. There are a variety of metrics to consider when assessing the underlying value of a coin/token.  
## On-Chain Metrics 
### Hash Rate
Hash rate is the combined computational power used to mine new blocks. A high hash rate indicates a secure network with many competing nodes which are miners interested in mining for profit.
Hash rate also helps miners determine their own profitability -- hash rate would decline if miners found their profitability was suffering. This may lead to miner capitulation and selling off of hardware.
Hash rate often has a direct and positive correlation with price. 
### Addresses
The number of addresses is the number of wallets. Comparing rate of growth in active address of different time periods is a simple method to gauge interest. Active addresses and price often have a positve correlation albeit weak.
#### New Addresses
Refers to the number of new addresses in specific time frame. 
#### Whale Addresses
Additionally, whale addresses (>1000 BTC) are often a good place to look when considering how 'smart money' is behaving. 
### Transactions

#### Value
The value of transactions over a specified amount of time. 10 transactions of 100BTC is equal to 1000BTC value transacted. The more value transacted the greater the circulation of the coin/token. The average transaction value can also shed light on investors with higher concentration of a coin/token.

#### Fees
Reflect demand for transactions to be verfied and added to the next block. 
Each chain has a different fee structure thus, comparing value of fees from chain to chain is illogical.
Comparing relative fees of the same chain may indicate an increased network demand and potentially increase in coin/token value. 

#### Transaction Count
Shows the count of transactions per day after filtering failed transactions. Looking at the number of large transactions is also an indicator of institutional or whale investors. Often referred to as 'smart money'

### Other On-Chain Metrics
#### Futures
#### Perpetuals
#### Options

## Financial Metrics 
###  (Trading Vol.)
Consistent positive volume in-flows should indicate a rise in price, 
while the opposite is true for consistent volume outflows. 

### Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of market depth. High liquidity suggests there are lots of buyers and sellers within an order book. 
Bid-ask spread is difference between sellers and buyers offer for a specified quantity of coins/tokens -- also a good measure of liquidity. 

### Supply
- Circulating Supply: The amount of coins that are circulating in the market and are tradeable by the public. 
It is comparable to looking at shares readily available in the market (not held & locked by insiders, governments).

- Max Supply: The maximum number of coins coded to exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency. 
It is comparable to the maximum number of issuable shares in the stock market.
Max Supply = Theoretical maximum as coded

- Total Supply: The amount of coins that have already been created, minus any coins that have been burned (removed from circulation). 
It is comparable to outstanding shares in the stock market.
Total Supply = Onchain supply - burned tokens

## Project Metrics
### White Paper
White paper is a technical document that outlines the purpose and operations of a project. 
Read with skepticism -- There should be some baseline information in any good white paper:
- Background
- Blockchain technology solution (Blockchain Architecture)
- Use Cases (Utility)
- Roadmap (Planned Improvements)
- Tokenomics (Economic Theory Behind Token Supply)
- Team Information

### Team
The team is vital for a successful project -- consider team member's past projects and VC firms interested in the project. 

### Competitor Comparison
This is simpkly competition between protocols looking to solve the same issue. AVAX vs ETH, SUHSI vs UNI, AAVE vs COMP, etc.
Often each protocol isn't solving the exact same problem -- must consider the nuance of each protocol and how that may affect price of token. 

### Project Road Map
Projects should have a roadmap to outline what improvements are being made. Past roadmap goals can be compared to measure the achievement of milestones.
Also important to consider what the improvements entail. A tokenomics update could have sizeable affects on the price of the asset. 
On the other hand, some improvements may have no affect at all. Consider the wider implications of improvements and what that may do to other investors.
Ex. Eth merge in 2022 could create massive swings in the price of ETH.

### Tokenomics
Tokenomics is the economic theory behind token supply. Simple economic theory implicates that the higher the demand relative to supply the higher the price and vice versa.
Tokenomics of a project may incentivize certain actions on the network. 

### Utility 
This is the use case of the token or the reasoning of why the token was created. 
- What problem is it solving?
- Good application of blockchain technology?
- Problem solving better than competitors?

## Sociopolitical Environment
What is happening around the world and how will that affect digital asset prices? China's ban of BTC mining caused a harsh drop in hash rate and thus price of BTC.

### News
World news whether that be 

# Technical Analysis
Analysis methodology for predicting future swings in the price of an asset using technical indicators. 

For discretionary trading, it is my belief that technical indicators should be used sparingly. 



# Other Deployment of Capital
## DeFi
### Capital Markets
Akin to traditional finance: spot + derivative markets
#### Futures
#### Options


### 'Passive' Rewards
In crypto markets, this refers to being rewarded with some token as a result of depositing your tokens/coins into a smart contract. More or less 4 flavors: 
#### Staking 
This is depositing your PoS token/coin into a contract and earn the native asset as a reward for securing the network. Fairly low APY's for coins: maximimum is around 8%
#### Liquidity Pools
DeXs support swaps for token pairs -- thus sending tokens/coins into this swap smart contract will yield a small fee from the swaps on those coin/token pairs. Paid out in unique tokens denoting pool share. Impermanent loss happens when providing liquidity for a LP and the price of the deposited asset changes in either direction.
###### Impermanent Loss Calculation Sheet
- price of deposited asset = % loss
- 1.25x price change = 0.6% loss
- 1.50x price change = 2.0% loss
- 1.75x price change = 3.8% loss
- 2x price change = 5.7% loss
- 3x price change = 13.4% loss
- 4x price change = 20.0% loss
- 5x price change = 25.5% loss
#### Lending
Through depositing coins/tokens into a smart contract, borrowers can secure flash loans with high interest rates. A portion of this interest rate is payed back to the depositor. Flash loans through smart contracts gurantee a repayment of the borrowed funds due to confirmed over-collateralization before the flash loan is processed.
#### Yield Farming
Similar to liquidity providing -- except it continues past one deposit of tokens for passive returns. Ex. depositor submits 1000 USDC & 1000 USDT into a Uniswap LP pool. Depositor receives 1XYZ token per day. Then they deposit XYZ token into another defi protocol in order to recieve more XYZ token or ABC token. These excess ABC or XYZ tokens may be deposited further or rotated to other tokens for higher returns.
